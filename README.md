# blackjack-simulator

Given a strategy chart, simulate many hands of blackjack to estimate wins, profit, and expected value. You are able to compare multiple strategies as well. See demo notebooks for examples.

User can specify game settings like blackjack payout, surrender payout, max splits, dealer hits soft 17 or not, and number of decks in the shoe. The simulator mimmics how shoe is used in actual play (no plans to update to offer setting with the machines that shuffle each hand).

Simulator will track the performance of each cell in the strategy chart and allow user to view metrics. Additionally each hand and action is tracked and also available to user. (see demo for both of these).
